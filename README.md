🎯 Objective
- To analyze student performance data and discover insights into how various factors affect academic outcomes in Math, Reading, and Writing.

❓ Problem Statement
We aimed to answer the following questions:
- What is the impact of parental education on student scores?
- How does test preparation influence performance?
- Are there disparities based on gender and ethnicity?
- Does socioeconomic status (indicated by lunch type) affect achievement?
- What are the correlations between different subject scores?

🛠️ Methodology

1. Data Cleaning & Processing — Python (Pandas)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization — Matplotlib, Seaborn
3. SQL-Based Querying — MySQL
4. Statistical Analysis — SciPy, StatsModels

🔍 Key Insights
- Gender Gaps: Females outperform males in Reading and Writing; males slightly outperform females in Math.
- Parental Education: Strong correlation with student scores—higher education leads to better outcomes.
- Test Preparation: Students completing test prep scored significantly higher across all subjects.
- Socioeconomic Impact: Students with standard lunch performed better than those with free/reduced lunch.
- Correlations: Strong positive correlations among all three subject scores.

⚠️ Identified Problems

- Demographic and socioeconomic performance gaps.
- Lack of test prep associated with lower scores.
- Disparities linked to parental education levels.

✅ Recommendations

- Implement targeted academic support for underperforming groups.
- Increase parental engagement and educational outreach.
- Expand access to test preparation programs.
- Provide socioeconomic support (e.g., meals, materials).
- Use early intervention and continuous performance monitoring.

📊 Tools & Technologies

- Languages: Python, SQL
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, StatsModels, SciPy
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, MySQL, PowerPoint

📈 Future Scope

- Integrate more datasets (attendance, extracurriculars, teacher feedback).
- Build predictive models to flag students at risk.
- Create an interactive dashboard for real-time tracking.
- Study the impact of different teaching methods on outcomes.
